It’s happening! The roller coaster ride that is 2020 continues straight into the most unusual Black Friday and Cyber Monday of the 21st century. BFCM is dead! Long live BFCM.

Yes, many stores will be closed or restricted to a certain capacity. And yes, far less in-person shopping is going to happen this year. But Black Friday is not dead. Quite the opposite: The high number of people working from home in the US means that we might have a larger BFCM than usual and that it might even stretch into the rest of the week as people use shopping to relieve stress about the world. Considering 40% of consumers reported purchasing online more this year than ever before, it is essential to optimize for the eCommerce experience.

While we expect that most people this year will think of Black Friday and Cyber Monday as two distinct events, we view these two events in 2020—and beyond—as functionally identical, a single shopping event that spans four days. Within a year or two, we expect most people will come to agree with us.

So how are merchants to handle this wild 2020 season?

Fear not! We have you covered. Here are our five tips to crush the start of the holiday season in 2020.
