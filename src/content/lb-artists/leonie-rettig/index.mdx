  - description: We experienced a creative miracle. Right from the first notes of Liszt’s B minor Sonata the audience was on the edge of their seats. It was as if Leonie Rettig began to read a long pianistic novel. Following on from last year’s Liszt bicentenary, Leonie Rettig had delivered such an overwhelming masterpiece that it was some moments before the applause began.
    title: Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung
  - description: Right from the first work on the programme this unusual way of playing showed its merits, with a performance ranging from inward contemplation to transfiguration, beginning and ending with an imposing song line in the tenor register, accompanied by harmonically brilliant figurations in the right hand.
    title: Schwarzwälder Bote
  - description: Leonie Rettig not only played, but rather commemorated the sonata in B minor by Schubert and the sonata in F minor by Brahms with contemplatively internalised but highly focused dedication. As a matter of fact, her lucid playing created an atmosphere as if both the materialistic boundaries and the temporal limitations had been repealed, almost appearing to be transcendental.
    title: Südwestpresse
  - description: "The four expansive movements of the work with their themes, now profound, now light-hearted; with their lyrical-like melodies and heavy chords, with dark and light passages and many still, pensive moments, were, in the hands of this musician, an experience ... in the vein of Robert Musil’s definition of art: ‘What is left of art? We are. As changed beings."

# Leonie Rettig | Piano

> “Unbelievable musicality” –Daniel Barenboim

Leonie Rettig is an outstanding pianist and undoubtedly one of today’s most interesting young artists, for she combines exceptional technique, great intelligence and tremendous, top-flight musical talent. Today, she is one of the “great up and coming pianists” according to the German NDR.

Leonie Rettig knew from her early childhood exactly what she wanted to do later in life. In an interview with IDAGIO, she stated:

> “I donʼt think I ever decided to become a pianist, except perhaps at the moment when, at the age of four, I stood tall before my mother and explained to her with heartfelt conviction that I was going to be a pianist. […] In truth, I always had this inner sense of belief, something I never questioned, that it was just completely natural for me to choose that path.”

She made her debut as a soloist at the age of 14 performing Edvard Griegʼs Piano Concerto. This was followed by concerts with the Nürnberg Symphony and the Landeskapelle Eisenach.

In the season 2018/19 Leonie was thrilled to be returning to Canada for a tour with Beethovens 3rd Piano Concerto under the direction of Bernhard Gueller as well as giving her Berlin debut with the Sinfonie Orchester Berlin and Stanley Dodds. She performed Brahms’ 2nd Piano Concerto at the prestigious Berlin Philharmonie.

The young pianist has been invited to perform at important festivals such as the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, Beethovenfest Bonn and the MiTo Festival in Milan and Turin, at the Oberstdorf Summer Music Festival, the Schloss Haigerloch Concerts, the Leipzig Summer Piano Festival and the International Chamber Music Festival Viana do Castelo; she has also given recitals in Portugal, South Africa, China, Switzerland and Argentina.

She was acclaimed equally by audiences and the press for her tremendous, sell-out recital in one of the North German Radio (NDR) broadcasting halls during the Pro: Musica Concerts in Hanover, which was recorded by NDR.

Besides being a professional concert pianist and occasional writer, she is also engaged in social projects and willing to put herself in uncomfortable places when she feels it’s needed. Following threats by e-mail and multiple demands to step back from a charity concert given for the Deutsch-Israelische Gesellschaft, she was forced to perform this concert under police protection. During the refugee crisis in 2015, Ms. Rettig spent nights and days supporting people in emergency shelters she has helped to build up. This led her organizing a successful charity concert for refugee children at the Kammermusiksaal der Philharmonie Berlin. This concert in collaboration with UNICEF was played alongside one of Germany’s most well-known actresses Katja Riemann, as well as colleagues and chamber music partners. She also continuingly performs for various organizations in Germany, such as Aktion 100000 in Ulm, supporting local families in need.

In the spring of 2016, she delighted her audience when she played Ravel’s Concerto in G major with Symphony Nova Scotia under the baton of Bernhard Gueller. She also gave a series of solo and chamber music performances there the same year as well as giving interviews on the local radio and on national TV. In March 2017, she gave a masterclass at the Universidad National de los Artes in Buenos Aires.

Her debut album including works by Schubert and Liszt, sponsored by the former cellist of the Berliner Philharmoniker and founder of the twelve Cellists, Rudolf Weinsheier, was exclusively released on the platform IDAGIO. The CD is now being published by the Berlin based label EuroArts Music International as a bonus CD in a luxury DVD Box including an extensive booklet text written by the multi-talented artist herself. In 2019, she was approached by EuroArts to write a text on 25 piano concertos which resulted in an essay on the Art of Interpretation as well as 25 individual texts.

Ms. Rettig’s current chamber music partners include the cellist Tanja Tetzlaff, the violinist Elisabeth Kufferath and musicians of the Berlin Philharmonic such as Alexander Bader, Stanley Dodds, Richard Duven, Anna Mehlin and David Riniker. She is currently invited to perform at the prestigious Easter Festival with the Berlin Philharmonic in Baden-Baden to perform chamber music with Alexander Bader and Richard Duven as well as the Beethoven Marathon at the Kammermusiksaal der Philharmonie Berlin.

In November 2020, she appeared on Daniel Hope's highly acclaimed TV production [Hope@Home](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/100560-014-A/hope-home-next-generation/) to perform alongside the violinist and talk about her love for Schubert and Chopin as well as the importance of a profound understanding of the music.

In early 2006; Leonie Rettig went to study with Vladimir Krainev at the piano faculty of the College of Music, Drama and Media in Hanover. One of the last pupils of Heinrich Neuhaus, Krainev was her teacher until his sudden death in 2011. Piano works ranging from the sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti to those of Henri Dutilleux are part of her extensive repertoire, in which works of the Romantic era form the core. With her profile as musician, writer and passionate dancer and including all of these art forms into her career, Leonie Rettig stands out exceptionally in the classical music industry.

Leonie Rettig is a [Steinway Artist](https://www.steinway.com/artists/leonie-rettig).
