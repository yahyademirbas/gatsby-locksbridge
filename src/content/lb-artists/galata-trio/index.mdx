# Galata Trio

Galata Trio; a young, dynamic and unusual trio founded by clarinetist Selin Gürol, bassoonist Oswin Carruido and pianist Kandemir Basmacıoğlu.

The name Galata Trio is inspired from the Galata Tower, one of the oldest and most iconic symbols of Istanbul, and also contains clues from their story. The Tower is the host of many legends, like Hezarfen Çelebi trying to fly from it, is an inspiration for Galata Trio: The mystical, strong and brave character of Galata Tower, witnessing many empires, languages and religions for centuries.

The Trio members met in various places around the world and came back to Istanbul. They make experimental practices in chamber music.

Venezuelan bassoonist Mr. Carruido started playing his instrument with El Sistema. He took part in masterclasses of famous bassoonists such as Klaus Thunemann, Carlo Colombo, Laurent Lefevre, Stefano Canuti and Hennin Trog. He was accepted as a student by Matthiac Racz after winning the auditions of Zurich Opera, where only one person is welcomed annually, by qualifying for the "Master of Science in Specialization in Orchestra". He also received the first prize in the 1st Venezuela International Bassoon Competition as well as played with orchestras such as Südwetdeutsche Philharmonic and Zurich Opera Philharmonic. He worked with conductors such as Claudio Abbado, Sir Simon Rattle, Gustavo Dudamel, Christian Vasquez, Domingo Hindoyan, Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos and Sung Kwak.

Pianist Kandemir Basmacıoğlu started playing piano in Kyrgyzstan and completed his bachelor's and master's degrees at Bilkent University Faculty of Music and Performing Arts with honors in the class of Anna Garibian and Gülnara Aziz. He was honored with DAAD Artist Scholarship from Germany and studied in Hochschule für Musik Köln. There, he studied with Professor Vassily Lobanov.

Clarinetist Selin Gürol, a member of LB Artists, has accomplished many national and international projects. She is one of the long-awaited clarinetists.
