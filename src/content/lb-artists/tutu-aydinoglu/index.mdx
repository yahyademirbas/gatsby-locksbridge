# Tutu Aydınoğlu | Piano

An extraordinary talent and an exceptional pianist. Her discipline and perfection are rarely found in any other. Pianist Tutu Aydınoğlu, who started playing piano at the age of 6, is an academician and pianist at the Istanbul University State Conservatory. She has performed as the soloist for the Turkish Premiere of Respighi’s Concerto in modo misolidio at Istanbul ICEC and left the audience with fascination. The pianist, who stands out with her unique interpretations and instincts to discover the neglected and the new, reflects her interests as a pianist with her wide repertoire and her career.

The project “Ottoman Traces in Western Music” which was curated by Ms. Aydınoğlu, organized at Istanbul Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall, gathered attention from all kinds of people including the press. In her project “One Nation, Two States” which she also curated as the artistic director, she performed the Piano Concerto on the Amirov-Nazirova Arab Themes at the Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall with her performance as the soloist accompanied by Cemal Reşit Rey Symphony Orchestra.

Professor O. Abaskuliyev’s student, pianist Tutu Aydınoğlu has become the student of Professor Meral Yapalı; gained recognition by taking part in masterclasses of François Chaplin, Mstislav Rostropovic and Andre Diev. She was honored by giving reception concerts in Hamburg and Poland.

Moreover, Ms. Aydınoğlu has premiered two works of Azerbaijani composer Pike Axundova. The first of these works is “İstiklal Trio”, which was composed for the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The world premiere of this work has taken place at 28th of May, 2018 in Turkey (Istanbul) and Baku premiere was on September 24, 2018 both by Tutu Aydınoğlu herself as the pianist. In addition, the artist performed the world premiere of the “Su Kasidesi Oratorio” inspired by the great Turkish Poet Fuzuli in Istanbul on March 19, 2019 under the direction of Rengim Gökmen.
