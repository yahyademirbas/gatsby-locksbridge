  - description: This phenomenon personality, the harp's acrobat, exemplified the climax of music-making consciousness. In Chagatay, understanding, sensation, intuition, invention, creation, musical consciousness are in a reflex state. When he hugs his harp, you will not believe your ears. He is a musical person and most importantly he has a rare cultural maturity.

# Çağatay Akyol | Harp

> This phenomenon personality, the harp's acrobat, exemplified the climax of music-making consciousness. In Chagatay, understanding, sensation, intuition, invention, creation, musical consciousness are in a reflex state. When he hugs his harp, you will not believe your ears. He is a musical person and most importantly he has a rare cultural maturity. –Ahmet Say / Music Writer

Çağatay Akyol started working as a solo harpist in the Presidential Symphony Orchestra when he was only 19 years old. With his hypnotizing depth, virtuosity and musical intelligence, he is one of the most important representatives of his era.

In his youth, he represented our country for the first time in many international youth orchestras. D.A.A.D. He graduated from the Berlin Academy of Music with high honours and worked with Mariana Schmidt Krickeberg and Regina Herving.

He gave concerts at the world's most prestigious festivals such as the Salzburg Music Festival, Wien Modern, BBC Proms, Mahler Festival, Budapest Spring Festival, Schleswig Holstein Music Festival, Festival de Radio France en Montpellier and Ferrara Musica. He played with world-renowned conductors such as Claudio Abbado, Bernard Haitink, Riccardo Chailly, Peter Eotvos, Michael Gielen, Yakov Kreisberg, James Judd, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Tugan Sokhiev, Daniel Gatti and Daniel Harding.

He played as a guest artist with the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra and Dresdner Staatskapelle. Akyol was invited as a jury member to the Felix Godefroid International Harp Competition in 2006. Between 2008-2010, he worked as a guest artist in the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.

In addition to his two CDs labeled Kalan Music, Lyrical Harp and Blok Flute (November 2004) and Harp and Violin with Cihat Aşkın (July 2009). In Anatolia Project about the theme of Hittite music sponsored by the European Union Project, he is the first and only person who plays Hittite Lyre.

He set out to share Anatolian music with the whole world by establishing Arpanatolia, which combines Anatolian instruments with the harp.

In the Mesopotamia Symphony, one of the pianist and composer Fazıl Say's works, his extraordinary performance as a bass-block flute soloist was remembered.

Akyol, who frequently gives concerts in Korea, was invited to Hong Kong as part of the World Harp Congress. He met with the audience in many important centers of the world including China, Canada, Ukraine, Russia, Germany, Japan, America and Italy.

Akyol is on his way to create own school with his original line, artistic intelligence, productivity and versatility.

Akyol continues his duty as a solo harp player in the Presidential Symphony Orchestra.
