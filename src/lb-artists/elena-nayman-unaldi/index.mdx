# Elena Nayman-Ünaldı | Viola

Elena Nayman-Ünaldı, born in Russia, started playing violin when she was 5 years old. Later on, at the age of 12, she fell in love with the viola’s dark, stately, reedy and warm timbre and decided to continue her career with the viola. She became a student of State Artist Elena Ozol and later on Roman Balashov at Moscow Tchaikovsky State Conservatory.

Elena had the opportunity to work with the world-renowned violist Yuri Bashmet at the "Chigiana Academy of Music" of Siena, Italy. She participated in the "Kamarihelmi" chamber music festival of Finland in 2016 and 2018.

Elena Nayman-Ünaldı currently teaches viola and chamber music at Bursa Uludağ University State Conservatory of Turkey. You don’t even have to hear Elena. You can see what she has to say with her instrument.
