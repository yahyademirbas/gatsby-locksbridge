The pianist, who stands out with her unique interpretations and instincts to discover the neglected and the new, reflects her interests as a pianist with her wide repertoire and her career.

The project “Ottoman Traces in Western Music” which was curated by Ms. Aydınoğlu, organized at Istanbul Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall, gathered attention from all kinds of people including the press. In her project “One Nation, Two States” which she also curated as the artistic director, she performed the Piano Concerto on the Amirov-Nazirova Arab Themes at the Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall with her performance as the soloist accompanied by Cemal Reşit Rey Symphony Orchestra.
